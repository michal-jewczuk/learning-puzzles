# learning-puzzles
The goal of this project is to create a simple java script puzzle game that lets you load a picture, set the number of parts to cut it into, shuffle all and then allows to reorganize in correct order.

This is more or less a learning experiment as I do not have a whole picture in my head yet how I should proceed. I expect the code to be rather messy as I write some parts to learn new tricks and then delete it and rewrite to serve my purpose.

## technologies
I will try to use only java script in version ES6 with no additional libraries like jquery. I want to have a full controll of the code. I see no need for node - maby later when I want to add some tests. The project should contain only index.html file, one or two .css files and a couple of .js files - at least that is my goal now.
